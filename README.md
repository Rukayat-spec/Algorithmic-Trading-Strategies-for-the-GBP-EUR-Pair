**Project Title**
Algorithmic Trading in Forex: Machine Learning Approaches for GBP/EUR Profitability.

**Research Question** 
How can machine learning algorithms be used to develop profitable trading strategies for GBP/EUR forex trading? 

**Project Overview** 
Forex trading involves the exchange of currency pairs, aiming to profit from changes in exchange rates. Algorithmic trading leverages computer programs to execute trades based on predefined rules, often informed by historical data and predictive models. This project focuses on creating and assessing algorithmic trading strategies for the GBP/EUR currency pair. It will utilize machine learning models such as Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Gaussian Processg to predict market trends and improve trading outcomes. The strategies will be evaluated through backtesting on historical data and compared against baseline trading strategies to assess their profitability and robustness. This exploration aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of machine learning in developing profitable forex trading strategies.
